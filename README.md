# Contribute

**All contributions are welcome!**

This project is setup with automatic semver versioning based on your commit semantic. It uses [`commitizen`](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) to enforce the format and help contributors format their commit message. We follow Angular's [conventional commit format](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines). Once you want to commit your work, you need to:

1. `git add` the changes you want to commit.
2. Run `npx cz` to start the commitizen CLI.
3. Follow along the wizard to create your commit.
4. Push your commit on the branch.
5. Create your PR.
